My very first project for the foundation year at university.

# OutManumber

OutManumber is a digital board game developed using Flowgorithm as a foundation year project. In this two-player game, participants traverse a game board, encountering spaces with positive and negative numbers. Landing on a positive number propels you forward, while a negative number sends you backwards, with the magnitude determining the number of spaces moved.

## Overview

- **Players:** 2
- **Platform:** Flowgorithm (visual programming)
- **Objective:** Be the first to reach the end of the board by strategically moving, making the best of positive and negative spaces.

## Rules

- The board is composed of a sequence of numbered spaces, each containing a positive or negative number.
- Players take turns rolling a die (or choosing how to move, as per game logic).
- When a player lands on a space:
  - If the number is positive, move forward by that many spaces.
  - If the number is negative, move backwards by that many spaces.
- If a move would take a player before the start, remain on the first square.
- The first player to reach or go beyond the last square wins.

## How to Play

1. **Open the Flowgorithm file:**  
   Open `James Fothergill OutManumber Game.fprg` in [Flowgorithm](https://flowgorithm.org/).
2. **Start the game:**  
   Run the program using Flowgorithm's interface.
3. **Follow the prompts:**  
   Enter player names and take turns as guided by the program.
4. **Play continues** until one player wins by reaching the final square.

## Educational Value

OutManumber demonstrates foundational programming concepts including:
- Flow control (loops, conditionals)
- Variables and input/output
- Game logic and turn-based interaction

It is suitable for those new to programming and game design, especially as an introduction to visual programming with Flowgorithm.
